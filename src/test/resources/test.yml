# material is the bukkit name for the material.
# requirements is the amount of the material needed to create a reinforcement.
# return is the amount of material to return.
# percent_chance is the chance to return the block. Scales with damage.
# scale_amount is, if maturation is enabled, the amount extra to damage a block if it is not fully matured.  The forumla for calculating the extra damage is 1/(1-((time left of maturation) / (default amount of time for maturation))) * scale.  So if a block has 5 minutes left of maturation on a 10 minute default period with a scale of 3 we do 1/(5 / 10) * 3 = 6 damage. Setting scale amount to 0 disables this function.
# effect allows to add particles around a reinforced block when it is created or damaged.

#  offsetX: the amount to be randomly offset by in the X axis

#  offsetZ: the amount to be randomly offset by in the Z axis

#  particleCount: the amount of particle to display. 
#  view_distance: the distance from which players will be able to see the effect. default is 16.
